# Diagnosing-Brain-Tumors-using-MRI-Scans
This project works on constructing an efficient neural network model and training it on a dataset of Brain MRI. The goal of the project is to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that belong to one of the four classes of brain tumor taken with a high accuracy.
